#   Question 1: Write a Python code that prints numbers from 1 to 10 on the screen.

# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(i)
    
#   Question 5: Write a Python program that takes a positive integer input from the user and calculates its factorial. Factorial is the product of all positive integers between a number itself and 1.
        # For example: if the user entered 5, the program should give the following output:
        # Enter a number from the user: 5
        # Factorial: 120

# number = int(input('please write a number: '))
# factorial = 1
# k = 1
# while k <= number:
#     factorial *= k
#     k += 1
# print('factorial ', number,' = ', factorial)



#   Question 9: How to create a combination of loop and conditional statement that takes a word 
# input from the user and checks whether that word is a palindrome (the same when read backwards)?

# word = input('please write a word: ')
# if word.lower() == word[::-1].lower():
#     print(word,' is a palindrome')
# else:
#     print(word, " is not a palindrome")
